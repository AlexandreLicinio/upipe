Plans for core:
 - reduce stack consumption in ubuf
 - autoregulate pools
 - thread pool support in upump-ev

Plans for modules:
 - trickplay support for multiple programs (needed for TS file transcoding)
 - partial rewrite of TS mux for better scheduling
 - timestamps on flow definition after demuxes

Bugs documentation:
 - doubly declared functions (due to __attribute__((format)))
 - @hidden doesn't work for #define
 - "TM" unicode char
