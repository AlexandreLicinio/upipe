Shitty APIs:
 - ulist
 - flow defs
 - uprobe: easier adhoc creation? impossible to chain "generic" common probes. policy for passing probes to subpipes?
 - ubuf_mem rework

Plans for core:
 - ubuf_sound
 - thread pool support in upump-ev
 - rewrite ubuf_mem
 - fast memcpy/memset ?

Other plans:

Bugs documentation:
 - doubly declared functions (due to __attribute__((format)))
 - @hidden doesn't work for #define
 - "TM" unicode char
